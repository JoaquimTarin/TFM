This repository contains the code, datasets, and other files used for the work on my master's thesis for the Creation of Neural Networks to work as Geochemical Surrogate Models in Reactive Transport Simulations.

It contains four different kinds of files:
1. .ipynb: these are the notebooks that contain all of the programming used for the data processing and NN creation. They include the preprocessing file for the RTM-generated dataset and the training pipelines for the three different NNs.
2. .pqi: these are the PHREEQC files with the geochemical descriptions of the systems used to equilibrate the randomly sampled datasets.
3. .yml: these are the files with the ranges for the generation of the randomly sampled dataset inputs.
4. .csv: these are the datasets used in the NN creation process (both pre- and post-processed).
5. .txt: for the .csv files too large to upload here, a url to a google drive with these files is presented instead.
